Due to security reasons I did not disclose my personal server. However to execute the program and to connect to 
the DB all that is required is replacing the XXX and XXXXX in the Database class. 
Replace XXX with your username for the mySQL DB connection you wish to use. 
Then replace XXXXX with the password for that connection

In order to send emails you must first register accounts. You may only send messages to other emails that are in the
database.
