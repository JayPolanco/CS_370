Due to security reasons I did not disclose my personal server. However to execute the program  all that is required is replacing the XXX
and XXXXX in the Database class. 
Replace XXX with your username for the mySQL DB connection you wish to use. 
Then replace XXXXX with the password for that connection

***All that is required of you is to create a schema on MySQL called showings.***

This project made the assumption that the DB tables already contained data and therefore do not require the creation of tables while
executing. Instead I have provided the SQL code that creates sample tables/data to be used to execute the Project.
Just copy and paste these codes onto a mySQL query.
